## What is a flag?

A flag is a text string found in a challenge that proves it has been solved. The flag gets submitted for points.

All flags follow a specific format so you should know when you've found it. the common format here is picoCTF{}.
	e.g. picoCTF{l33tsp34k_phr4s3_1234abcd}
The stuff in the brackets is known as leet speak, a language.

## CTF Categories

- General Skills: Challenges that build your comfort with essential tools and concepts — things like using the Linux command line, reading source code, navigating file systems, and working with encodings like base64 or hex. These tend to be on the easier end and are a great starting point if everything else feels overwhelming.

- Cryptography: Challenges involving encoded or encrypted data that you need to decode or break. Early challenges might have you recognizing and decoding common schemes like Caesar ciphers or base64. Harder ones introduce real cryptographic algorithms (RSA, AES) and ask you to exploit weaknesses in how they're implemented. Ranges from beginner-friendly to very advanced.

- **Forensics**: Challenges where you investigate files, disk images, network captures, or other digital artifacts to find hidden information. You might analyze an image file with something secretly embedded in it, sift through packet captures, or recover deleted data. Difficulty varies widely, but many entry-level forensics challenges are approachable early on.

- **Web Exploitation**: Challenges that involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Beginners might inspect page source or manipulate cookies, while harder challenges involve SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or server-side logic bugs. Moderate to advanced, though the introductory ones assume no web security background.

- **Reverse Engineering**: Challenges where you're given a compiled program and need to figure out what it does — usually to discover what input produces the flag. You'll use tools like disassemblers and debuggers to read assembly code or trace program behavior. Generally moderate to advanced, with a steeper initial learning curve.

- **Binary Exploitation**: Challenges where you exploit memory-safety vulnerabilities in compiled programs — buffer overflows, format string bugs, use-after-free, and so on. This is widely considered the hardest category, building on reverse engineering skills and adding exploitation techniques. A few introductory challenges ease you in, but the category ramps up quickly.

## How to Approach Challenges

- Read the challenge description carefully.
    
- Look at the hints for the challenge (there is no penalty for viewing hints).
    
- Download any files from links in the description.
    
- What types of files are these?
    
- Check endpoints, other links or services that you can access using the challenge description.
    

It's ok to get stuck, that means you have the opportunity to learn something. Take maybe 30 minutes to try and figure it out. Googling key words and concepts is highly expected! If you can't get it, try stepping away from the screen for a few minutes. Return and tackle the challenge again. If you're still stuck look up a writeup for the challenge on Google. This is not cheating by any means. You may have an AI assistant help as well. AI can respond very precisely to your challenge if you ask it to just give you a hint or a nudge in the right direction.
